    <p> Adele Blue Atkins was born in 1988 in northern London. In 2006 she graduated from the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology where initially she wanted to work in the artists and repetoire department of a record label. A friend of hers published some of her songs to MySpace leading to meeting with an exec from XL Recordings. In 2008 she released her debut album 19, named for her age at the time of recording the songs. She went on to win the Grammy for Best New Artist for her work on the album. In 2011 she released her sophmore album, 21 which garnered her worldwide recognition. She went on to win six Grammys in all the categories she was nominated for the album. This made her the second female to win that many awards in one night. She later recorded Skyfall, the titular song for a Jame Bond movie of the same name, that earned her first Oscar win. Her most recent album, 25, was released in 2015 with the lead single being "Hello" becoming at the time the fastest song to reach one billion views on YouTube (reaching it in 88 days). Adele's artistry can be described as soul with folk, country and blues influences. Her simplicity as a musician makes her a remarkable artist that has a focus on her music and voice which is rarely seen in present day.</p>
